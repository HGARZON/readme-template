# Readme template

The idea of this project is to improve our documentation in our day-to-day work by having a complete readme file.

## How to use it?

If you're entering a project for the first time, or if you are working in one where there is no documentation whatsoever, this is the perfect readme template for you.

First, find out all the information asked in here and then edit you project readme file. You are making this a better earth to work :)
