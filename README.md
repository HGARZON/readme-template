# Readme template

The idea of this project is to improve our documentation in our day-to-day work by having a useful readme file.

## How to use it?

If you're starting a new project or if you are already working on a proyect where there is no documentation whatsoever, this is the perfect readme template for you.

Take the [readme-template](readme-template.md) and make it your own.

Feel proud! You are making the world better :)
